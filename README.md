# macOS Beta Downloader

A script that makes downloading macOS betas easier by using fetch-macOS.py. Automatically downloads Big Sur by default, allthough if you wanted to you could download regular macOS versions with this script.

This script is intended for KVMs, so there's an option to convert BaseSystem.dmg to an img file to attach to the VM. However, making a USB installer for a regular mac with the dmg file is possible. 

This script is designed to run on Linux, running it on macOS should be possible as long as you have the dependencies but I haven't tried it.

All dependencies *should* come with your distro, and the rest should be taken care of by the script. However, if I missed a dependency please make an issue and I'll add it to the script.
